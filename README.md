# Sportradar-coding-challenge

This is a Sporadar Coding Challenge built with [React.Js](https://reactjs.org/).<br />

## Instructions

You are working in a sports data company, and we would like you to develop a new Live Football
World Cup Scoreboard library (or frontend application) that shows all the ongoing matches and their
scores.

The scoreboard supports the following operations:
1. Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
This should capture following parameters:
a. Home team
b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
team score.
3. Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same
total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.
